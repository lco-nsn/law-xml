      <heading>General</heading>
      <text>The Tribal Governing Board is the governing body of the Tribe. Pursuant to the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the LCOHA is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities. The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</text>

      <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
      <text>The LCOHA is a public body established as a subordinate entity of the Tribe pursuant to 11 LCOTCL Chapter 7. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties, as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the LCOHA, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of Subchapter 4.12, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>
    </section>
    <section>
      <num>4.303</num>
      <heading>Employment Laws</heading>
      <text>It is the general policy of the Tribe to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on LCOHA operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

      <heading>Indian Preference</heading>
      <text>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000 <em>et. seq. </em>prohibits various forms of discrimination, including racial, color, gender-based, religion or national origin within the employment context. However, similar to the United States government, Indian tribes are expressly exempted from the definition of a covered "employer." Consistent with this exemption, the Tribe grants Indian preference in employment, and will apply preference in the following order when there are two or more candidates that meet the job qualifications:</text>

        <text>Employees can take up to twelve (12) weeks of leave under this policy during any twelve (12) month period. The LCOHA will measure the twelve (12) month period as a rolling twelve (12) month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any leave under this policy. Each time an employee takes a leave, the LCOHA will compute the amount of leave you have taken under this policy and subtract it from the twelve (12) weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount an employee is entitled to take at that time. An employee's family or medical leave taken may run concurrently with other types of leave including workers' compensation and other leaves, such as short-term or long-term disability, etc.</text>

The Tribe offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO-CHC during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>

        <text>While the Tribe/LCOHA encourages its employees to enjoy and make good use of their off-duty time, certain activities on the part of employees may become a concern if they have the effect of impairing the work of any employee; harassing, demeaning, or creating a hostile working environment for any employee; disrupting the smooth and orderly flow of work within the office; or harming the goodwill and reputation of the Tribe. In the area of social media (print, broadcast, digital, and online services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Plaxo, and Twitter, among others), employees may use such media in any way they choose as long as such use does not produce the adverse consequences noted above. For this reason, the following provisions apply regarding an employee's use of social media, both on and off duty:</text>

In such a situation, the employees involved should request guidance from their program Director or the Executive Director to discuss the possibility of a resolution that would avoid such problems.

It is in the best interest of the LCOHA and all employees that these issues be resolved as quickly and fairly as possible; therefore, the LCOHA supports an "open-communication policy" to encourage addressing these issues. The following "Problem Solving Process" has been designed to provide guidelines for resolution of questions, problems or conflicts:</text>

      <text>Each employee shall agree to, by signing, a Consent to Appeal Procedure as a condition of continued employment. The Appeals Procedure constitutes a contract between the Tribe/LCOHA and the employee and establishes the framework under which employees may appeal disciplinary action imposed under this subchapter or employment claims, provided no employee can appeal any disciplinary action based on activity that results in an arrest and conviction. In addition, regarding employment claims, it is important to note that nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe/LCOHA consenting to application of any law or waiving applicable defenses, including the defense that the subject law does not apply to the Tribe/LCOHA.</text>
