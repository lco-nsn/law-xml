      <heading>Application</heading>
      <text>This ordinance shall govern all contracts and grants for the procurement of supplies, services, and construction entered into by the Tribe.  It shall apply to purchasing, irrespective of the source of funds, including contracts, which do not involve an obligation of funds (such as concession contracts); however, nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the Tribe from complying with the terms and conditions of any grant, contract, gift, or bequest that is otherwise consistent with law.</text>
      <text>When both federal and non-federal funds are used for a project, the work to be accomplished with the funds should be separately identified. The term "<em>procurement</em>," as used in this ordinance includes both contracts and modifications (including change orders) for construction or services, as well as purchase, lease, or rental of supplies and equipment.</text>

      <heading>Severability And Non-Liability</heading>
      <text>If any section, provision or portion of this ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby. The Tribe further asserts immunity on its part and that of its agencies, employees, and/or agents from any action or damages that may occur as a result of reliance upon and conformance with this ordinance.</text>
    </section>
    <section>
      <num>2.108</num>
      <heading>Consistency With Good Business Practices</heading>
      <text>The fundamental goal of the Tribe's procurement system is to satisfy end users in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service while complying with applicable laws, rules, and the Tribe's own policies. Further, those involved in the procurement function should exercise personal initiative and sound business judgment in providing best value product or services in meeting the tribe's needs.  Consistent with that goal, the CPO may assume that, if a specific strategy, practice, policy or product is in the best interests of the Tribe and is not addressed in this ordinance, nor prohibited by tribal law, federal law, or other directive including this procurement ordinance, the strategy, practice, policy or procedure may be a permissible exercise of authority. The CPO is advised to seek advice whenever doubts arise about an intended strategy, practice, policy or procedure.</text>

    <section>
      <num>2.109</num>
      <heading>Public Access To Procurement Information</heading>
      <text>Certain information about the Tribe's procurements are normally considered public (e.g. name of the winner contractor and total contract price) and may be released to the public in accordance with this procurement ordinance as well as applicable tribal laws and regulations governing information.</text>
      <text>Other information related to procurement is often protected from disclosure (e.g., proprietary business information such as technical methods or processes, detailed pricing information, personal information, or other information).  The Tribe must exercise caution to ensure that protected information is not made public. Contracting personnel should consult the Tribe's Legal Department whenever there is any question regarding the release of information.</text>

      <heading>Chief Procurement Officer Signature/Obligation Of Funds</heading>
      <text>Each contract or purchase action (e.g., new contract, modification, interagency agreement, purchase order, etc.) that obligates the Tribe to pay a contractor or vendor must be approved by the TGB or otherwise authorized by an individual to whom the Tribe has expressly delegated the authority to make such an obligation.</text>
      <text>The approval of the TGB on contracts is a legal commitment and requires continuing performance by the Tribe under the terms and conditions of the contact. Performance includes such duties as monitoring contractor performance and for the acceptance or rejection of contractors' requests for changes in performance, specification, or price.</text>
      <text><strong>Caution:</strong> Only the TGB is authorized to bind the Tribe by making an implied contract such as making a promise or stating an intent to purchase, either orally or in writing. Under the laws of the Tribe, the Tribe may be liable for, or bound by, an action of the CPO, or his/her designee only if the offeror has been given authority by the TGB. Therefore, all unapproved actions that could be misinterpreted as committing the TGB to purchase should be clarified with a statement such as, "this request for price quotation is not an offer to buy and should not be assumed as such."</text>

The TGB should consider any changes in the procurement environment (e.g., new laws, regulations, market conditions, or buying needs and practices of the Tribe) when assessing the qualifications for personnel and the need for additional training.</text>

        <heading>General.</heading>
        <text>Planning is essential to managing the procurement function properly; however the type and extent of planning will depend on, among other factors, the method and size of the procurement, with larger and more complex procurements requiring more planning.</text>
        <para>
          <num>(a)</num>
          <text>Careful advance planning provides the Tribe with adequate time to accomplish its procurement actions. Advance planning helps to: maximize competitive pricing among contracts and decrease the Tribe's procurement costs; without any need for re-procurement, e.g., resolving bid protest; and minimize errors that occur when there is inadequate lead-time. Contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, and invitations for bids or requests for proposals must be excluded from competing for such procurements.</text>

          <text>The Tribe should periodically review their record of prior purchases, as well as future needs to find patterns of procurement actions that could be performed more efficiently or economically. Items purchased repetitively might be obtained more economically through various master contracts. 	However, consideration should be given to storage, security, and 	handling requirements when planning these types of purchasing actions. 	For example, it may not be economical or prudent to buy truckloads of a product at deep discounts if there is no appropriate storage space for the product or if the cost of handling the product would exceed the savings price.</text>

        <text>While the CPO is responsible for the preparation of the ICE, other personnel (e.g., the end user, or budget and finance) are usually involved and may actually do most of the preparation.  The Tribe may develop the ICE using its own employees, outside parties (e.g., consultants), or a combination of the two. If any outside party (whether compensated or not) assists in developing the ICE, the Tribe must take the appropriate action to ensure that organizational conflicts of interest are avoided and that the outside party does not obtain any competitive advantage from its advance knowledge of the Tribe's cost estimate.</text>

          <text>The level of detail will vary but should be commensurate with the size (i.e. dollar value), complexity, and commercial nature of the requirement. ICEs are normally broken out into major categories of cost (e.g., labor, materials, and other direct costs such as travel, overhead, and profit). Commercially available products and services may require less detail as the marketplace tends to provide current reliable pricing information for commercially available products; a CPO may also not need to break out components. Non-commercial type requirements, and work designed specifically for the tribe will require much more extensive estimation and detailed ICE.</text>

        <text>The ICE serves as the primary in-house gauge of cost and price reasonableness, but it should not be relied upon to the exclusion of other sources of pricing information. Market conditions may fluctuate between the time the ICE is prepared and the receipt of offers. For example, materials or labor cost may have increased or decreased. If a significant period of time has elapsed, or the CPO knows that certain market conditions have changed, the CPO should request that an updated ICE be prepared to use in evaluating offers.</text>

          <strong>INDIAN PREFERENCE GUIDELINES</strong>

      </para>
      <text>
        <strong>INDIAN PREFERENCE:</strong>
      </text>
      <text>Eligibility for Indian preference shall be established in accordance with the requirements of federal law. If the Tribe or its prime contractor determines an applicant ineligible for Indian preference, the Tribe or its prime contractor shall notify the applicant in writing before contract award, or filling the position, or providing the desired training.</text>
      <text>The Tribe may restrict procurement activity to eligible Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</text>
      <text><strong>Restricted Solicitations.</strong>  The Tribe may provide Indian preference in procurement activities by advertising for bids or proposals from only qualified Indian organizations and Indian owned-enterprises.  Or, the Tribe may use a two-stage preference procedure.  The regulations describe the two-stage procedure as follows:</text>
      <text><strong>Stage 1.</strong> Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid announcement or request for proposals limited to Indian-owned firms.</text>
      <text><strong>Stage 2.</strong> If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</text>
      <text>If the solicitation is restricted to qualified Indian owned economic enterprises and organizations, and two or more (or a greater number determined by the Tribe and stated in the invitation) qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, award shall be made to the qualified enterprise or organization with the lowest responsive bid.  If equal low bids are received, drawing lots or similar random method shall make award, unless otherwise provided in state, tribal, or local law.  If fewer than the minimum number of qualified Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations submit responsive bids, all bids shall be rejected, and the Tribe shall cancel the solicitation.  The Tribe may accept a single bid received from a responsible bidder, subject to HUD approval for HUD projects, in unusual circumstances, such as if the Tribe determines that, based on a cost or price analysis, the bid price is fair and reasonable, or the Tribe determines that the delay of re-soliciting would subject the project to higher costs.</text>
      <text>Unrestricted Solicitations.  If the Tribe isn't able to award a contract based on the procedures described in the previous section, the Tribe shall re-advertise the contract inviting bids from non-Indians as well as Indian owned economic enterprises or organizations.</text>
      <text>The Tribe may require information from prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises.</text>
      <text>Complaints arising from any of the methods the Tribe utilizes to implement Indian preference shall be conducted in accordance with this ordinance.</text>
      <text>
        <em>Award shall be made under unrestricted solicitations to the lowest responsive bid from a qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise or organization within the maximum total contract price established for the specific project or activity being solicited, if the bid is no more than 15% higher than the total bid price of the lowest responsive bid from any qualified bidder.</em>
      </text>
      <text>
        <em>If the bid from the qualified Indian-owned economic enterprise of organization is within the (15%) range of the lowest, non-Indian firm, the Indian-owned firm will be given the opportunity to meet the lowest bid price. Should the Indian-owned firm refuse to meet this lower price, the bid shall then be awarded to the responsive and responsible low bidder for the project.</em>

      <text>
        <em>Bidder # 4:	$116,000.00	Indian Firm</em>
      </text>
      <text>
        <em>Bidder # 3, a non-Indian-owned firm, is the apparent low bidder for this project, Bidder # 2, an Indian-owned firm is within 15% (of Bidder # 3. Bidder # 2 is then provided the opportunity to meet the dollar amount of Bidder # 3's bid. If Bidder # 2 is unable to meet Bidder # 3's bid, the award shall be made to Bidder # 3, if Bidder # 2 is able to meet the lower bid, the award shall be made under this Indian Preference Policy. The Tribe must always ensure the lowest, responsive and responsible bid is made for every solicitation, under the Informal or Formal Bidding procedures of this document.</em>

      </text>
      <text>If needed, the Chief Procurement Officer or designee should request Davis Bacon wage-rates as determined by the Department of Labor at least forty-five (45) days prior to the initial solicitation for construction contracts. This determination must be provided to the bidder at the time the quote is requested. At least ten (10) days before award of the contract, the CPO or designee should confirm that the work is considered eligible for Davis-Bacon wage rates.</text>
