      <text>The Tribal Governing Board is the governing body of the Tribe. Pursuant to the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the Tribe is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities. The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</text>

      <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
      <text>The Gaming Enterprises are a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Tribe established pursuant to Title XII, Chapter 1 of the LCOTCL – Gaming Code. The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Pursuant to Title II, Chapter 5 of the LCOTCL – Sovereign Immunity Code, immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe or any of its subordinate entities such as the Gaming Enterprises, unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, including without limitation the provisions of Subchapter 9.12, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

      <heading>Employment Laws</heading>
      <text>It is the general policy of the Gaming Enterprises to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Gaming Enterprises looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Gaming Enterprises' consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

EAP provides referrals to local community treatment sources and all visits are held in confidence.  EAP appointments will be coordinated with the team member's supervisor, using the chain-in-command policy, so customer service does not get interrupted. Participation in EAP does not excuse team members from complying with the provisions of this ordinance or from meeting normal job requirements during or after receiving assistance.

      <text>The Gaming Enterprises' goal is to establish and maintain a work environment that is free from the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs and abused prescription drugs. The Gaming Enterprises recognize that a successful approach to the problems associated with alcohol or illegal drug use requires an interaction of education, assistance, deterrents, and discipline.

While the employer has no intention of intruding into the private lives of its team members, it does expect team members to report for work in a condition to fully perform their duties and to refrain from the use of illegal drugs, the abuse of alcohol, and/or the abuse of prescribed medication while on duty.</text>

        <text>Being subject to the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs, or abused prescribed medication in the team member's work environment is normally just-cause for the team member to be referred for alcohol and drug testing. However, being subject to the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs, or abused prescribed medication does not excuse a team member's misconduct that violates any of the employer's rules, policies, procedures, or regulations. For example, an assault committed while subject to the effects of alcohol, illegal drugs, or abused prescribed medication will subject the team member to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, because of the misconduct.</text>

A team member's decision to enter an Employee Assistance Program is considered voluntary when the team member enters the EAP before a referral by an appropriate medical official or a drug test that subsequently tests positive.
