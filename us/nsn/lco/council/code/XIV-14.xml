      <heading>General</heading>
      <text>The Tribal Governing Board is the governing body of the Tribe. Pursuant to the Amended Constitution and Bylaws of the Tribe, ultimate legal and fiscal responsibility of the Tribe is with the Tribal Governing Board, as the elected representatives of the members of the Tribe. The Tribal Governing Board possesses the inherent sovereign authority to delegate oversight and management responsibilities to program directors for the planning and daily operations of Tribal programs and entities. The Tribal Court interprets and enforces, in accordance with and subject to applicable law, as well as these policies and procedures established by the Tribal Governing Board.</text>

      <heading>Sovereignty</heading>
      <text>The Tribe is a sovereign nation, with inherent reserved rights recognized through federal treaties; as such the tribe exists within the geographical boundaries of the United States. Immunity from private lawsuits is one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty. Immunity from suit means that no private lawsuit can be maintained against the Tribe unless the Tribe consents to the action. Nothing in this manual, constitutes a waiver of the Tribe's inherent sovereign immunity.</text>

    <section>
      <num>14.303</num>
      <heading>Employment Laws</heading>
      <text>It is the general policy of the Tribe to extend to its employees, where possible, the rights and benefits provided by employers regulated by the laws of the United States. However, the Tribe looks to federal employment laws as guidelines only, and nothing in this personnel policy and procedural manual shall be construed as the Tribe's consent to application of such laws. Another aspect of the Tribe's inherent sovereignty is that Wisconsin Statutes are not applicable on Tribal operations without the express written permission of the Tribal Governing Board. The Tribe reserves the right to create and modify its employment laws and policies without regard to such laws or interpretations thereof.</text>

      <text>The LCO Development Corporation recognizes that individual employees may develop personal problems which could have negative effects on job performance. The LCO Development Corporation offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all employees, the purpose of which is to encourage the early diagnosis and treatment of personal, psychological, and medical problems. Employees are encouraged to contact the Human Resource Director, or designee, for information regarding the EAP. Employees are responsible for submission of all documents and paperwork to pay the costs incurred for services rendered in connection with the EAP. Employees may utilize their health insurance plan as coverage is available; otherwise the service will be self-pay. Employees may attend a scheduled EAP appointment with the LCO Clinic during work hours. If the EAP appointment is at another facility the employee may use permitted paid or unpaid leave for EAP absences. EAP appointments (that the employee is required to attend by the Employer) will be coordinated with the employee's supervisor so customer service does not get interrupted.</text>
